REST Sniffer is a tool that assists developers as well as non-technical users to better understand exposed Application Protocol Interface (API). As nowdays (RESTful) APIs follow similar guidelines, it is possible to monitor and formalize pre-defined Web services.
The tool is based on Google Chrome (provided as an extension) and allows to add 3rd party plugins that hook into its core functionality.
